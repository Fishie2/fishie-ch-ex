# Fishie

A chrome browser extension created to empower Twitter users. Leveraging several open source APIs, Fishie allows users to quickly analyze suspicious tweets and receive quantitative metrics on toxicity, fake news, and probability of being a bot account.

Fishie is a collaborative, ongoing project with the long-term goal of identifying Twitter users of tweets that are psychologically manipulative; empowering users to think critically about online discourse.
